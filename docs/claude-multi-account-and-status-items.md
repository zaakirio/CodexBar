# Claude multi-account and status item decision

Status: **Phase 1 account display implemented; Phase 2 explicit account activation accepted.**

Related: [#1756](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/1756),
[#1268](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/1268), and the bounded Claude sign-in repair in
[#1811](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1811).

## Accepted direction

1. Use an opt-in `claude-swap` adapter as the first Claude subscription multi-account source.
2. Normalize its results behind a provider-neutral account snapshot before adding any status item UI.
3. Make per-account status items opt-in, replace the provider item for that provider, cap selection at four, and keep
   them mutually exclusive with Merge Icons.
4. Allow an explicit click on an inactive account card to invoke exactly `cswap --switch-to <slot> --json`. Keep
   automatic switching and session launching out of scope.

This solves the durable OAuth refresh problem without making CodexBar a second credential vault. It also avoids a
Claude-only status item implementation that would need to be redesigned for Codex and other providers.

## Current architecture and gap

CodexBar has three account concepts today:

- The ambient Claude OAuth credential is routed from CodexBar's cache, Claude Code's credentials file, or Claude
  Code's Keychain item. It represents one active credential. Claude Code-owned expired credentials delegate refresh
  back to the CLI; CodexBar-owned cached credentials can refresh directly.
- `ProviderTokenAccount` stores a label and one token plus optional provider metadata. It has no refresh token or
  expiry model. Claude entries therefore work for session cookies, Admin API keys, or short-lived OAuth access tokens,
  but they are not durable multi-subscription OAuth sessions.
- `TokenAccountUsageSnapshot` and `CodexAccountUsageSnapshot` separately project multi-account usage into menus.
  Status items remain provider-scoped: `StatusItemIdentity` has only `merged` and `provider`, and
  `statusItems` is keyed by `UsageProvider`.

The recently merged [#1800](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1800) scopes Claude OAuth history to the routed
Keychain identity. [#1776](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1776) prevents CLI-runtime usage refreshes from
delegating credential repair to Claude Code, while app and user-initiated repair remain available. Both changes improve
single-active-account correctness; neither discovers or displays multiple subscriptions.

The closed [#1707](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/pull/1707) should not be revived. It coupled account discovery,
credential resolution, provider routing, menu rendering, and animation across a large patch while broadening
Keychain and prompt behavior. The safer seam is a credential-free usage adapter first.

## Source options

| Option | Credential ownership | Durability | Risk | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-party OAuth account vault | CodexBar | High | New login, refresh, storage, revocation, migration, and security surface | Defer |
| Bounded `claude-swap` adapter | `claude-swap` | High | External executable and schema dependency | **Phase 1–2** |
| Discover Claude Code Keychain entries | Claude Code / ambiguous | Unknown | Undocumented enumeration; prompt and identity hazards | Reject |
| Existing token accounts | CodexBar config | Low for OAuth | Access token expires without refresh metadata | Keep for current cookie/API-key uses |

As of [`claude-swap` v0.18.0](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap/releases/tag/v0.18.0),
`cswap --list --json` still returns a versioned object with `schemaVersion: 1`, an active account number, account slots,
redaction-sensitive email labels, 5-hour and 7-day usage percentages, optional model-scoped weekly windows, and reset
timestamps. Handled failures return an error object and non-zero exit. Direct switching returns the same versioned
envelope. CodexBar does not need
`--token-status`, credential files, Keychain access, or raw OAuth values for display or explicit activation.

## Phase 1 adapter contract

- Disabled by default. User chooses an executable path and enables “Read accounts from claude-swap.”
- Execute exactly the argument array `cswap --list --json`. Never invoke a shell or accept config-defined passthrough
  arguments.
- Require `schemaVersion == 1`; reject unknown versions and partial top-level shapes.
- The optional top-level `supportsAccountSwitching` boolean defaults to `true` for schema-v1 compatibility.
  With `false`, account cards and chips remain inspectable but never offer switching or re-authentication actions.
  A present non-boolean value (including `null` or a number) is rejected as a malformed capability.
- Bound runtime and stdout, terminate on timeout, and retain the last successful snapshot with a stale marker.
- Parse only slot number, active state, usage status, 5-hour/7-day percentages, optional `usage.scoped` display names
  and percentages, reset timestamps, display-only `organizationName` (always present, may be empty), and optional
  display-only `alias` when non-empty. Ignore malformed or unknown scoped rows without discarding valid account-wide
  windows. Unknown extra JSON fields remain ignored. Empty `organizationName` is not an error; `alias` is not required.
- Use optional `usageFetchedAt` for the measurement's last-updated time, so polling the adapter's cache does not make
  old usage appear freshly measured. Missing or malformed timestamps retain the refresh-time fallback and valid windows.
- Parse optional display-only `usage.spend`, `disabled`, and `lastGoodUsage` with `lastGoodFetchedAt`. Malformed additive
  fields fail independently of valid live windows; ignore the row's free-form `message`. Source-declared last-known
  measurements keep their own timestamp and a visible age beside diagnostics, and never drive the age-less menu icon
  or ready-account suggestions. Cache only numeric quota data, capture time, provenance, and the existing account fingerprint.
- `unavailable` does not establish a polling-failure cause. Retain the existing same-account, unexpired at-limit
  windows only when the source supplies no explicit last-good measurement; preserve their freshness provenance.
- Disabled slots are excluded only from source-owned automatic rotation. They remain explicit switch targets;
  `foreign_credential` is also recoverable through the existing explicit slot activation contract.
- Treat email, organization name, and alias as display-only. Never log or persist them. Respect Hide Personal Info.
  When two or more slots share an email, disambiguate with `email · organizationName` or `email · Account N`; a
  user-chosen alias wins. Unique emails stay email-only.
- Use the source-issued numeric slot for identity (`claude-swap:<slot>`), not email or credential-derived values.
- The claude-swap usage adapter never reads `claude-swap` storage, Claude Code storage, environment credentials, or Keychain entries. The
  subprocess remains solely responsible for its own credential access. The adapter copies only allow-listed
  usage/identity fields into its model and never logs or persists raw stdout.
  Separately, the local cost scanner reads only session `projects` logs under known claude-swap profile roots, as
  documented in [claude.md](claude.md#cost-usage-local-log-scan); it does not read the adapter's credential storage.
- Never run `auto`, `run`, `--switch`, `--switch-to`, `--add-account`, export, import, purge, or any other command in
  Phase 1.
- Isolate adapter failure from ambient Claude usage and discard canceled list/version reads. Users without
  `claude-swap` see no behavior change.

The executable is an optional external dependency, not a bundled component. Preferences should show detected version,
last refresh, adapter errors, and a link to the upstream project; CodexBar should not install or update it.

## Phase 2 explicit activation contract

- Only an explicit click on an actionable account card or actionable inactive account chip can start a switch.
  Normal activation targets inactive slots.
  An active slot reporting `foreign_credential` offers **Re-authenticate**, using the same slot command so claude-swap
  can reconcile its proven credential mismatch. No force flag is used; selecting the active segment remains inspection-only.
- The Segmented layout labels its chips **Switch Claude Code account**. An inactive actionable chip switches Claude
  Code's credentials; active and unavailable chips only inspect that slot. Chips retain their short account identities,
  with action-specific tooltips and accessibility labels that respect Hide Personal Info.
- Derive the numeric slot from the already validated account snapshot and execute exactly
  `cswap --switch-to <slot> --json`; never accept free-form arguments or invoke a shell.
- Serialize switches, validate `schemaVersion == 1` and the returned target slot, and bound captured output.
- Once launched, let the external credential transaction reach its natural exit without forced timeout or
  cancellation. If the adapter setting changes, hide its UI state and discard its result when the original
  configuration is no longer current.
- Refresh ambient Claude usage and the adapter account list after completion. Publish known switch errors before
  waiting for that refresh, independently from list-refresh errors, and preserve the last successful usage snapshots.
  Keep the transaction guard until reconciliation finishes; discard the error if its configuration changes.
- Show **Switching account…** while the external command is running, then **Refreshing account status…** while
  ambient usage and the independently scheduled adapter account list are reconciled. Wait for a replacement list read
  while its configuration is still current. Update the open menu through its tracking-safe rebuild scheduler; keep the
  requested slot and disabled controls through both phases. The adapter's refreshed account list alone determines active styling,
  and a known switch error remains visible beside progress. This feedback does not diagnose or shorten a slow refresh.
- Configuration invalidation clears visible progress without cancelling the transaction. Returning to the same
  executable path cannot revive the old phase or error, and another activation waits for the original task to drain.
- Keep expired, missing, unknown, and Keychain-inaccessible credential slots non-actionable. Never auto-switch, launch
  sessions, add/import/export/purge accounts, or mutate credentials directly.

## Fork addition: Claude Code seats source

`claudeAccountSource = "seats"` (fork-only) reads subscription usage for every Claude Code seat
without an external adapter. Each seat is a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`; the reader probes it through the
same bounded Claude CLI `/usage` machinery as the ambient card with that seat's directory in the
probe environment, so every seat's credentials stay Claude Code-owned (each probe reads and
refreshes only its own Keychain item). Contract:

- Configure seats as `name=path` entries (`claudeSeats`), comma or newline separated. An empty
  list discovers `~/.claude` and `~/.claude-*` directories holding a `.claude.json`.
- Rows reuse the claude-swap projection: seat name is the display alias, slot number is identity,
  the first seat is marked active (it is the ambient credential), and
  `supportsAccountSwitching` is always false. Seat cards are inspect-only; switching stays
  claude-swap-owned and the switch path refuses to run in seats mode.
- A failed seat renders as an unavailable card and its error joins the adapter error text;
  sibling seats are unaffected. Cancellation stays global.
- Background refresh ticks reuse per-seat probes within the 15-minute expensive-local-work floor
  (`ClaudeSeatsProbeCache`); a cached snapshot expires when any of its windows resets.
  User-initiated refreshes always probe. Row timestamps carry the real measurement time.

## Provider-neutral account model

Introduce one projection used by menus and status items rather than teaching status item code about Claude OAuth:

```swift
struct ProviderAccountUsageSnapshot: Identifiable {
    let id: ProviderAccountIdentity
    let provider: UsageProvider
    let displayLabel: String
    let isActive: Bool
    let canActivate: Bool
    let snapshot: UsageSnapshot?
    let error: String?
    let sourceLabel: String?
}

struct ProviderAccountIdentity: Hashable {
    let source: String
    let opaqueID: String
}
```

Adapters own identity conversion. UI receives a user alias or privacy-safe ordinal when personal information is hidden.
No provider may fill identity, plan, or usage fields using another provider's data.

Existing `TokenAccountUsageSnapshot` and `CodexAccountUsageSnapshot` can migrate behind this projection in small,
separately reviewed steps. Their credential and refresh logic stays source-specific.

## Per-account status item behavior

Proposed setting under each provider's Accounts section:

- `One provider icon` (default; current behavior)
- `Selected account icons`, with up to four account checkboxes

Selecting account icons replaces that provider's aggregate item; it does not add duplicates. Account items use a
stable `StatusItemIdentity.account(provider:source:opaqueID:)`, preserve existing provider autosave names, and open the
provider menu focused on that account. A short user alias or ordinal badge distinguishes otherwise identical provider
icons. Hide Personal Info replaces labels with `Account 1`, `Account 2`, and so on.

Merge Icons continues to mean exactly one status item. Account-icon controls are disabled while it is enabled, with a
button to turn Merge Icons off. Existing users and status item positions remain unchanged until they opt in.

The alternative proposed in the #1268 discussion is a per-account toggle that adds selected account items, leaves
unselected accounts under the provider item, and coexists with Merge Icons. That is more granular, but it creates
duplicate provider/account items, makes “Merge Icons” no longer mean one item, and multiplies autosave and recovery
states. The replacement mode above is the recommendation; if maintainers prefer the additive mode, grouping and Merge
Icons semantics must be decided before implementation.

## UI proof

The mock above shows the recommended mode and its Merge Icons conflict. It is intentionally a decision artifact, not
an implementation screenshot. The following packaged synthetic-account proof verifies the bounded current behavior:
the separate ambient OAuth action is named “Sign in with Claude Code…”, while inactive claude-swap cards retain their
explicit “Switch Account…” action. No real credential, browser session, or provider call was used.

![Packaged synthetic Claude sign-in proof](screenshots/claude-sign-in-synthetic-proof.png)

## Accepted decisions

1. The optional external `claude-swap` dependency is accepted for exact `cswap --list --json` execution and explicit
   `cswap --switch-to <slot> --json` activation.
2. Automatic switching, account add/import/export/purge, and session launching stay out of scope.
3. Provider-neutral account snapshots land before any per-account status item work.
4. Per-account status items are capped at four and mutually exclusive with Merge Icons.
5. Status item labels use aliases or privacy-safe ordinals, never email identity.

Any further change to these decisions requires a new product/auth review before implementation because it changes
storage, status item migration, process authority, or the credential boundary.

## Implementation and validation sequence

1. Add fixtures for schema v1, error payloads, unknown versions, invalid percentages/timestamps, output limits, and
   process timeout. Use a fake executable only.
2. Add the opt-in adapter and provider-neutral projection. Verify no credential reads and no impact on ambient Claude.
3. Add settings-state and menu-model tests. Keep AppKit status item creation out of headless tests.
4. Add status item identity/migration tests, then implement account items behind the opt-in setting.
5. Add exact-argv, strict switch-result, serialization, and refresh tests using a fake executable only.
6. Run focused tests, `make check`, `make test`, packaged synthetic proof, and macOS UI proof with redacted fixtures.

No credential import, automatic switching, session launching, or compatibility shim is part of this proposal.
